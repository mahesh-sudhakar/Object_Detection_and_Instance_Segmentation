# Object_Detection_and_Instance_Segmentation

**Instance segmentation on stereo vision images of KITTI dataset, using YOLOv3 object detector and depth data.**

NOTE: Please upgrade to the latest opencv version to avoid errors.

1. Kindly create new folders inorder to save results.
	i) data/test/est_depth
	ii) data/test/yolo
	iii) data/test/est_segmentation

2. The bounding boxes are saved as numpy arrays and accessed later 
during the instance segmentation process. So it's important to follow step 1.
